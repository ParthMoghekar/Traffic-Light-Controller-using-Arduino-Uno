# Traffic-Light-Controller-using-Arduino-Uno

This project is done to give you an idea of how the traffic light controller works. This is not the real time traffic light controller.
So at start, green light of signal 1 and red lights at other signals will light up to give time to the vehicles at signal 1 to pass.
After 5 seconds, the yellow light at signal 1 will light up to give an indication that the red light at signal 1 is about to come up and also to give an indication to the vehicles at signal 2 that the green light is about to light up.
So after 2 seconds, red light at signal 1 will come up and green light at signal will come up meaning vehicles at signal 1 must stop and vehicles at signal 2 can move.
Similarly the traffic light controller will work for the signal 3, signal 4 and the system will keep looping.

Objective:
Roads without any supervision or guidance can lead to traffic conflicts and accidents. Traffic signals are required for an orderly flow of traffic. A traffic signal is used as an instructing device that indicates the road user to act as per the displayed sign.
Traffic lights allow everyone to cross the intersection point one by one, reducing conflicts between vehicles entering intersection points from different directions. It provides road safety, also helps to solve traffic in simple manners.
There are different colours in traffic lights. Each light has a meaning, and these lights tell drivers what to do.
•	Red light ON- A driver should stop.
•	Yellow light ON- A driver has to slow down and be ready to stop.
•	Greenlight ON- A driver can start driving or keep driving.

Software Detail:
•	Arduino Uno
•	Breadboard
•	LEDs ( Red, Yellow, Green)
•	Resistor( 220 Ohm)
•	Dupont cables.
